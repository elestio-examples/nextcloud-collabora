# Activate CRON jobs

The best setting is to use the CRON option in Nextcloud, to configure it go to https://[CI_CD_DOMAIN]/settings/admin
and select the CRON option in the list (recommended)


# Language Setting

By default, Nextcloud will determine the Web-GUI's language and load it in that language. If you'd rather load it in a different language, however, you can do so by following the procedures listed below.

1. Open Elestio dashboard -> CI/CD -> Open terminal / Vs code
2. If you open the terminal, type the command (nano config/config.php), otherwise, open config.php in the config folder in vs code, and add the following line at the end of the array object.
 ``` 
 "force_language" => "en"   
  ```   
3.  Then restart the Pipeline.
 ```   
docker-compose down;
docker-compose up -d;
 ```
Similarly, you can swap out "en" with any other language you like, for as "fr" for French.
