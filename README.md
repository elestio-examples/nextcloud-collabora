Navigate to Files.
Click create new + to upload supported files, or choose between text, word document, spreadsheet, or presentation files to create.

# Activate CRON jobs

The best setting is to use the CRON option in Nextcloud, to configure it go to https://[CI_CD_DOMAIN]/settings/admin
and select the CRON option in the list (recommended)

# Language Setting

By default, Nextcloud will determine the Web-GUI's language and load it in that language. If you'd rather load it in a different language, however, you can do so by following the procedures listed below.

1. Open Elestio dashboard -> CI/CD -> Open terminal / Vs code
2. If you open the terminal, type the command (nano config/config.php), otherwise, open config.php in the config folder in vs code, and add the following line at the end of the array object.

```
"force_language" => "en"
```

3.  Then restart the Pipeline.

```
docker-compose down;
docker-compose up -d;
```

Similarly, you can swap out "en" with any other language you like, for as "fr" for French.

# Talk Configuration

This readme provides step-by-step instructions on configuring Talk for your NextCloud instance.

## Configuration Steps:

### 1. Enable Talk App

- Open your NextCloud dashboard.
- Click on your user icon in the top right corner.
- Select "Apps" from the drop-down list.
- Navigate to the `Social & communication` apps section.
- Locate the "Talk" app, download it, and enable it.

### 2. Update STUN Server and TURN Servers

- Go to the following URL in your web browser:

      https://[CI_CD_DOMAIN]/settings/admin/talk

- Scroll down to the `STUN Server` section and update the current STUN URL to:

      [CI_CD_DOMAIN]: 3478

- In the `TURN Servers` section, add the following details:

      turn:only
      [CI_CD_DOMAIN]:3478
      <PASSWORD>
      UPD AND TCP

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with the value of the `STATIC_AUTH_SECRET` environment variable, which can be found in the Elestio overview under "Update Config > ENV."

Now Talk is configured

### 3. Save Changes

- Ensure that you save the changes made to the Talk configuration.
